We’d wanted to get a dog for over eight years but there always seemed to be something in the way - we lived in a big city, we didn’t know how long we were going to stay in one place, our flat was too small… Until we arrived in the Chamonix Valley, a stunning corner of the world right in the heart of the French Alps.

Dog culture here is amazing, pups are allowed in cafes, bars and restaurants and it seems like almost everyone has a furry friend. We decided this was the time, we would find a house with a garden and go get the Galician Shepherd puppy we’d always wanted. And so the adventure began!

After a year with Millo, our first (and so far only) dog, we’ve decided to write a blog to share our experiences. From learning how to train a dog to what he loves and hates, our favourite hikes and more. Welcome to the world of Millo!
